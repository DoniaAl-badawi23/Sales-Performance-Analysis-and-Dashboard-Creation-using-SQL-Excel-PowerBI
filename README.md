# Sales-Performance-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in SQL and Excel and PowerBI, creating visual dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.  

# Sales-Performance-project (Interactive Dashboards Creation using Excel & PowerBI)

## Project Objective:
Sales Manager Request:
- We need to improve our online sales reporting and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
  Basically, we want to focus on how much product we sold, to which customers and how it fared over time.
  Since each sales rep works on different products and customers, it would be helpful to be able to filter them as well.
  We measure our numbers against budget, so I put that into a spreadsheet so we can compare our values ​​to performance.
  Budget for 2021 We usually look back two years when we do sales analysis..

  ## Final Conclusion:
 The dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of the business's strong performance, highlighting its ability to meet sales and budget targets. However,
 there are opportunities for improvement in product category diversification, geographic reach, and customer growth.

-  Key Strengths:

    Achieving 22M in sales, surpassing the 21M budget.
    A solid customer base of 18K customers with strong contributions from top-performing customers.
    Geographic sales clusters in high-demand regions like North America, Europe, and Asia.
    Exceptional performance in the Clothing category, contributing over 95% of total sales.

-  Key Challenges:

    Over-reliance on a single product category (Clothing) poses a risk.
    Limited sales contributions from underperforming regions (South America and Africa) and categories (Bikes and Accessories).
    Room to grow the customer base beyond the existing 18K.

-  Future Outlook:
  
    By focusing on diversification, customer acquisition, and regional expansion, the business can sustain growth and build resilience. Leveraging seasonal peaks and customer loyalty        programs can further enhance profitability.

  ## Sales Improvement Recommendations:
 1- Focus on Product Mix:

   Introduce promotions or bundle offers for underperforming categories like Bikes and Accessories to increase their contribution.

 2- Customer Retention Programs:

   Offer loyalty rewards or personalized offers to top customers like Jordan Turner to ensure continued engagement.

 3- Geographic Targeting:

   Invest in marketing campaigns in less saturated regions to expand the customer base globally.

 4- Seasonal Promotions:

   Leverage peak months like May, August, and October to maximize sales through discounts or limited-time offers.
