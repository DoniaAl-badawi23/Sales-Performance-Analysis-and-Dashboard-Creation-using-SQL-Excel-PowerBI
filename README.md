# Sales-Performance-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in SQL and Excel and PowerBI, creating visual dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.  

# Sales-Performance-project(Interactive Dashboards Creation using Excel & PowerBI)

## Project Objective:
Sales Manager Request:
- We need to improve our online sales reporting and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
  Basically, we want to focus on how much product we sold, to which customers and how it fared over time.
  Since each sales rep works on different products and customers, it would be helpful to be able to filter them as well.
  We measure our numbers against budget, so I put that into a spreadsheet so we can compare our values ​​to performance.
  Budget for 2021 We usually look back two years when we do sales analysis..
